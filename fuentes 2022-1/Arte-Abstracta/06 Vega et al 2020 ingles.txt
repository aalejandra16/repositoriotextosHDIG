After 1930.

In 1930 the Bachué group (active until 1950), named in honor of a Chibcha goddess, reacted against academicism and sought to move away from foreign topics taking as inspiration Pre-Columbian and indigenous cultures, dealing in some cases with mythological topics. Some of them worked on murals, in a manner similar to that of their Mexican contemporaries, in an attempt to direct their art at the community. Pedro Nel Gómez combined social themes with allusions to universal human values and included popular mythical figures from western Colombia in works such as Death of the Miner (1934– 1939; Medellín, Pal. Mun.); in expressive female nudes with mestizo features he explored themes such as exploitation and suffering (e.g. Violence, 1955; Bogotá, Mus. N.). Other artists associated with the group included Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo (1910–1970), Luis Alberto Acuña (1904–1994), and Gonzalo Ariza (1912–1995), whose focus on local landscape incorporated a strong Japanese influence. The expressionist painter Débora Arango meanwhile treated provocative social themes, such as the status of women, religion, and politics; her work was rejected until the 1980s on grounds of immorality and obscenity and because of her allusions to the political milieu.

Abstract art was introduced into Colombia with exhibitions of paintings by Marco Ospina (1912–1983) in 1949 and of works by the Constructivist painter, sculptor and printmaker Eduardo Ramírez Villamizar (1923–2004) in 1952. The experimental German-born Guillermo Wiedemann also played a decisive role, however, in its introduction, with works inspired by the tropical landscape and the inhabitants of the Pacific coast of Colombia (e.g. In the Corral, 1940; Bogotá, Mus. N.). Significant Abstract Expressionist painters included Armando Villegas, with such works as Electric Panorama (1958; Washington, DC, A. Mus. Americas). The Constructivist sculptor Edgar Negret, best known for his painted metal sculptures (e.g. Magic Gadget, 1959; Washington, DC, A. Mus Americas), became one of the most important abstract sculptors in Latin America, with a museum dedicated to his work (see §VII below).
In the 1950s, however, many artists continued to produce figurative work. The painter and printmaker Alejandro Obregón explored with vitality and dynamism the Latin American landscape and identity, using a contrasting language of color and brushwork. He also explored political themes, as in The Wake, painted in reaction to a massacre of students led by the military dictatorship in the 1950s. Fernando Botero achieved international renown with figurative paintings full of sensual monumentality, humor, and ironic commentary, as well as with sculpture, since the 1970s (e.g. Big Hand, 1976–1977; Washington, DC, Hirshhorn). Enrique Grau depicted his mostly Caribbean characters in peculiar situations (e.g. Girl in the Tavern, 1969; Bogotá, Fond. Cult. Cafetero) in his paintings and bronze sculptures.
In the 1960s geometric abstraction was represented by, among others, Carlos Rojas (1933–1997), Manuel Hernández (1928–2014), Fanny Sanín (b 1938), and Omar Rayo (1928–2010), who produced engravings using uninked intaglio and painting with strong optical effects (e.g. Trapped, 1960–1967; Washington, DC, A. Mus. Americas). Meanwhile, women were beginning to assume a leading role in Colombian art. Olga de Amaral (b 1932) used textiles to search for new structural and chromatic possibilities; the organic features of her work are evocative of the Andes, and materials such as gold leaf allude to Pre-Columbian and colonial cultures (e.g. Flag, 1984; Bogotá, Mus. N.). The sculptor Feliza Bursztyn was innovative with her installations, which incorporated the rusting debris of industrial society.
In contrast to the predominance of abstract art in the 1960s, there was a sharp return in the 1970s to figurative art, with an emphasis on technique. This was most evident in printmaking and drawing. Notable in this tendency were Luis Caballero and Dario Morales (1944–1988), who both depicted nudes, and David Manzur (b 1929). Pop art in Colombia was given a sharply regional focus, with unexpected touches of wit and social comment. Bernardo Salcedo assembled unrelated objects in boxes and collages, and Hernando Tejada (1924–1998) created imaginative items of furniture. Beatriz González (b 1938) reinterpreted popular images such as prints, news photographs, and pictures of popular heroes to create satirical associations about bourgeois taste or political criticism. Other artists associated with Pop art in Colombia include Santiago Cárdenas (b 1937), Ana Mercedes Hoyos (1942– 2014), and more recently Antonio Caro (b 1950), who developed graphic conceptual art during this period, and Nadin Ospina (b 1960) who playfully examined various sources of the construction of the hybrid Latin American identity.
In the 1980s the active artistic environment was supported by a flourishing publishing industry, increased promotion by galleries and the organization of important events by the museums of modern art of Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali, which provided alternatives to the more traditional Salón Nacional. This more diverse milieu produced an outstanding new generation of artists. Some 400 artists took part in the 33rd Salón Nacional in 1990, representing the diverse developments of the late 20th century.

The decade of the 1990s was one of experimentation, adoption of new media, and new attention to reality and socio-political context. This was influenced by the reflections motivated by the Quincentenary of the encounter between Europe and the Americas on issues of identity, auto- representation, plurality, postcolonial resistance, and rupture of hegemonic discourses. Miguel Angel Rojas (b 1946) produced experimental combinations of engraving and photography and focused on issues such as gender and narco-political violence in the country; his photograph David (2004) represents a nude of a mutilated young soldier evoking a classical sculpture. Oscar Muñoz (b 1951) experimented with processes of photography on unusual supports, investigating the nature of images and memory. Ma Teresa Hincapie (1956–2008), a pioneer of performance in the country, highlighted gender issues through the expression of personal rituals and inner life. Other artists have continued to contribute to the renovation of traditional media such as Jose Antonio Suarez (b 1955) who continuously develops in drawings an intimate journal, or Carlos Salas (b 1957), who reflected his personal inner life through a layered process of highly lyrical abstract painting.

During the 21st century many artists have focused on the socio-political problems related to the violence of narco-terrorism—involving guerrilla fighters, militias, and the national army—including massacres, disappeared people, and displaced populations. Among them María Fernanda Cardoso; the videos of Clemencia Echeverri (b 1950), such as Treno, which highlights the charged turbulence of rivers that have carried corpses; Juan Manuel Echavarria (b 1947), photographer and video artist, focused on giving visibility to the “war we haven’t seen” in his video Bocas de ceniza (“Mouths of Ash”) and developed a very poetic vision of desolated places such as vestiges of abandoned rural schools in his series Silencios (2010– ). The sculptor and installation artist Doris Salcedo, who has been the best known internationally, focused on the trauma of absence creating an oeuvre of collective mourning and reflections. Another topic, ecology and environmental issues, has been focused on in a diverse number of ways with increasing interest by contemporary artists who explore biodiversity and the socio- economic issues of various resources, such as mining.
