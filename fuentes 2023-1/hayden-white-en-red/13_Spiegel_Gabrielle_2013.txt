Rhetorical Theory/Theoretical Rhetoric:  Some Ambiguities in the Reception of Hayden White's Work
Gabrielle M. Spiegel
It goes without saying that one hardly needs to stress the critical importance of Hayden White's work to the development of historical thought over the last thirty-five years. Yet the precise ways it which that body of work was understood, and the complex response that the historical profession had and continues to have to Professor White's formulations concerning the nature of history and historiography is not equally evident. On the one hand, there is abundant evidence of resistance to his theories, to the point of active (if at times stealthy) rejection. On the other, there is also widespread recognition that Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe represented a significant intervention into questions of historical thought and writing, ignored only at one's peril. Having said this, however, it remains the case that the mixed response to White, initially to Metahistory, and then to the subsequent volumes of essays, was complicated by what I think were ambiguities in his theory of rhetoric and in the rhetorical ways in which he elaborated it, ambiguities that engendered correspondingly divergent tendencies and ambiguities in its reception.
In my view, these ambiguities were of a double nature, that is to say, they were both contextual and textual and involved not only these two domains in themselves, but the ways in which they interacted in his writings. Contextual, in the sense that it was not always easy to locate White's evolving propositions about the linguistic character of all historical narration within the larger field of theory, both structuralist and poststructuralist, that was, during the seventies and eighties, being deployed to large effect in all the humanistic disciplines. Textual, in the sense that White himself entertained ambiguous positions on

major issues such as referentiality, relativism, linguistic mediation and the like that were at the same time being considered anew under the pressure of a broad variety of critical theories, which in the historical fields eventually came together under the rubric of “the linguistic turn,” a phrase that only occasionally appeared in White's work.
Metahistory appeared in 1973, the same year that Clifford Geertz's The Interpretation of Cultures was published. What seemed to tie the two together, for those of us who read them more or less at the same time, was their common reliance on Northrop Frye for some key concepts concerning the nature of literary texts, since Geertz, no less than White, embraced a textualist position. While The Interpretation of Cultures, in many ways, owed more to Northrop Frye's theory of archetypes than to semiotics proper, Geertz clearly grasped and argued for a semiotic concept of culture as an “interworked system of construable signs,” which was to be the object of an interpretive, rather than a functionalist, anthropology. In his classic essay, “Deep Play: Notes on a Balinese Cockfight,” Geertz put to anthropological use Frye's insistence that the meaning of literary texts is expressive and formal, not instrumental, by treating the Balinese cockfight as a “sustained symbolic structure,” a way “of saying something of something,” whose meaning was to be understood not as a problem of social mechanics (how cockfights functioned within Balinese society to reinforce status, deploy power, advance interests, etc.), but of social semantics.1 Geertz's brand of cultural anthropology, as he later claimed, was “preadapted to some of the most advanced varieties of modern opinion,” which he defined as “the move toward conceiving of social life as organized in terms of symbols (signs, representations, signifiants, Darstellungen… the terminology varies), whose meaning (sense, import, signification, Bedeutung…) we must grasp if we are to understand that organization and formulate its principles.”2 Geertz's and White's common use of Frye and their mutually insistent focus on textuality—which in White's case lay at the heart of his critique of nineteenthcentury historicism and its fantasies of objectivity and transparency—meant, I think, that willy-nilly, White was pulled by the force of this context into a semiotic camp that he both inhabited and seemed often to neglect, if not downright disavow.
Indeed, in his writings, it was never entirely clear exactly where White stood in relation to semiotics, and hence to structuralism, not to mention poststructuralism. For a “theoretician” of historical narration as a fundamentally linguistic and literary art, he was and long remained disconcertingly vague about his precise understanding of how language, as such, functioned

173
and what he believed to be its intrinsic nature—which is only a way of saying that he was fairly disinterested in linguistics. And this remains the case despite his strong focus on rhetoric, for rhetoric is primarily a theory of how language works, rather than of what language is. Thus Robert Doran is surely correct in noting that, “although White sometimes calls himself a structuralist, his point of departure is not Saussurean semiology but Vichian rhetoric.”3
Nonetheless, White often seemed to embrace a semiotic model of language. Two early essays, “The Problem of Change in Literary History” (in New Literary History in 1975)4 and “Method and Ideology” (in the important collection edited by Dominick LaCapra and Stephen Kaplan in 1982),5 appeared to endorse a semiotic understanding of language in phrases like the following: “language is an instrument of mediation between human consciousness and the world that consciousness inhabits” (an assertion later repeated in “Fictions of Factual Representation”).6 This impression, moreover, was strongly reinforced by the constant references in his writings to Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and even Jacques Derrida, which seemed to align him with both structuralism and potentially with poststructuralism of the Derridian sort, although it soon became clear that White was not a poststructuralist, for all the reasons that Hans Kellner powerfully explained in terms of White's “linguistic humanism,”7 and which soon enough became apparent in White's essay on the “absurdist moment.”8 But White often offered approving judgments of the importance of Barthes, such as we find in “Literary Theory and Historical Writing,” in which he noted that “Barthes proffered the ‘text' in its modern linguistic-semiotic conceptualization as a new object… [I]f we follow out the implications of this suggestion, we can begin to grasp the significance of modern literary theory for the understanding of what is involved in our own efforts to theorize historical writing.”9 This sort of statement pointed, especially at the time, to structuralism as a governing scheme in White's understanding of both history and historical writing, hence constituting another contextual pull towards the linguistic turn, however possibly misguided. White's failure to specify his operative understanding of language (and his articulated disinterest in linguistics) left his “system” very much within the confines of neoclassical rhetoric, where, of course, he intended it to reside. But coming as it did in the midst of the linguistic turn, with its espousal of a strongly semiotic and even poststructuralist/deconstructive view of language, White's strong pronouncements on the importance of language and literary theory for historical writing were bound to be conflated with the foregoing by historians for the most part not accustomed to thinking along these lines.

h erWe White seemed to depart from the structuralist critics, whom he otherwise deployed to such great effect, was on the question of the degree to which language served not only as a mediating force between “consciousness and the world it inhabited,” but actually “constituted” reality via its particular linguistic mechanisms. After all, the key innovation of semiotics was to consider language not as a reflection of the world it captures in words, but as constitutive of that world, that is, as “generative” rather than “mimetic.” In structuralist and poststructuralist thought, mediation functions not, to borrow Fredric Jameson's definition, via “the intervention of an analytic terminology or code which can be applied equally to two or more structurally distinct objects or sectors of being”10 but rather, as Theodore Adorno defines it, “is in the object itself, not something between the object and that to which it is brought,” a concept of mediation that attempts to abolish (or overcome) dualism altogether.11 In this view, mediation is an active process that constructs its objects in precisely the sense that poststructuralism conceives of the social construction of reality in and through language. Hence language is anterior to the world it shapes, and what we experience as “reality” is but a socially (i.e. linguistically) constructed artifact or “effect” of the particular language systems we inhabit.
But did White share this view? And if not, why did he seem to by deploying aspects of semiotic theory and by citing structuralists and poststructuralists so often and so approvingly in his work? White's self-designation as a “formalist” did not necessarily resolve the question, since it defined his conception of how the historian approaches narrative, rather than how he approaches “reality” (i.e. did research), a question that, as his commentators frequently noted, he often bracketed in his work. Nor, as I hope to show in a moment, was the ambiguity necessarily resolved by his initial and seemingly primary focus on Vico's theory of tropes, despite the fact that this placed him squarely in a rhetorical rather than a semiotic context—but a rhetorical context of a rather special kind. It was the ambiguities in his treatment of language that, I believe, led to both a rejection and an acceptance of his narratology, whether presented in terms of tropes or discourse.
I linger on this this question because coming to terms with the ways in which White understood (and understands) language is critical to comprehending his notion of tropology and, with it, of the whole question of the referentiality of language, the core question for all historians, who are compelled to investigate an absent past primarily through the language the past itself generates. In short, for most working historians, as Peter Haidu once put it, theory “is forced to
Rhetorical Theory/Theoretical Rhetoric
175
reckon with reference—as unsatisfactory as contemporary accounts of reference may be—as a necessary function of language and all forms of representation.”12
Although White eventually came to focus more on discourse than tropology, it was the centrality of tropes in Metahistory that conditioned the ways in which historians understood his narratology and responded to his claims for its importance. Richard Vann, in his article “The Reception of Hayden White,” noted that patterns of citation to White and reviews of Metahistory written by historians tended to focus on his use of Northrop Frye's modes of emplotment “to the exclusion of his more radical view of the underlying tropes.”13 Doubtless, there were many reasons for this, not least the fact that the four primary tropes identified in Vico's neoclassical rhetoric were very hard to spell! But they were also very hard to grasp as historiographical mechanisms in the particular way that White presented them, since he so resolutely insisted that, following Vico, tropes were not merely figures of speech (something even historians could comprehend) but, rather, functioned as figures of thought and, indeed, as he continued to elaborate his position, appeared to be analogous—even identical— to cognitive modes and forms of consciousness. Historians were encouraged to read him this way by statements such as “the figurative language used to characterize the facts points to a deep structural meaning.”14 This placement of the tropes on a deep level of consciousness, together with their “prefiguring” opera-tions—critical for White's critique of old-style historicism—inevitably raised the question of whether the tropes were conventional (as literary figures of rhetoric) or structural, perhaps the most fundamental ambiguity in White's oeuvre, and the one with the most powerful consequences; since if they were structural, then it followed that the charges of relativism about the status of facts, data, events, truth, etc., had a genuine basis in White's thought.15 Moreover, it was here that the earlier ambiguity about White's relationship to structuralism and the “linguistic turn” interacted (probably in ways that were not entirely welcome to him) with his theories of tropes and discourse, so that ambiguities about the former inflected one's interpretation of the latter. In short, the question was: at what point does the prefiguring operation of the tropes begin, and are they constitutive, as well as ordering, of the historical record that makes up the content in the form of the historical account?
To be sure, White was always careful to point out that historical events differ from fictional events “in ways that it has been conventional to characterize their differences since Aristotle,”16 and he often referred to “raw data,” the “unprocessed historical record,” and “events in themselves” (“singular existential statements”),17 and even considered the “chronicle” as a non-narrativized
176
Philosophy of History After Hayden White
form of historical writing, a position that, as someone who works on medieval chronicles, I do not think really holds up and which, in any case, he himself rejected in “The Problem of Change,” when he protested that “the chronicle is a fiction which permits the historian to act as if he has found a world of data which his theories can then fashion into a cognitively secure body of knowledge… There is no such thing as a ‘chronicle,' tout court, of anything; there are only histories more or less structured.”18
Moreover, the specific ways in which he talked about the tropes seemed to belie his crucial exclusion of “data” and the “unprocessed historical record” from the operation of troping, since he often suggested, as Dominick LaCapra remarked, that such material was basically inert until animated—troped— “by the shaping mind of the historian.”19 On the most fundamental level, if we accept his definition that facts are “events under a description,”20 then the mode of description would seem to be determined, in some stronger or weaker sense, by the mode of troping employed. Indeed, White claimed that “there is no such thing as a single correct original description of anything, on the basis of which an interpretation of that thing can subsequently be brought to bear. All original descriptions of any field of phenomena are already interpretations of its structure.”21 Indeed, he claimed, one cannot, within discourse, “distinguish facts from interpretation,”22 that is, from their (always) already troped forms. And this does not even take into account the fact that historians, for the most part, even in their archival work, deal with texts, that is, with already narrativized or troped documents, making, as Dominick LaCapra repeatedly pointed out, the distinction traditionally drawn between text and “document” problematic, since both participate equally in the play and intertextuality of language itself. If facts are prefigured by their original description, then it would seem that a literal description of them is literally impossible.
This interpretative “reception” of White's position was abetted by his view that tropes “informed” the linguistic protocol the historian uses to prefigure the field of historical occurrences singled out for investigation, suggesting that, as in the case of semiotic theory, the linguistic protocol operates to constitute, and not merely to describe, the historical field as such. Or, as the Introduction to Tropics of Discourse appears clearly to state: “Tropics is the shadow from which all realistic discourse tries to flee. This flight, however, is futile; for tropics is the process by which all discourse constitutes the objects which it pretends only to describe realistically and to analyze objectively.”23 Perhaps White only meant to state the by-now anodyne position that there is no such thing as a historical fact until the historian identifies it as such; but that is not exactly what he said,
Rhetorical Theory/Theoretical Rhetoric
177
and the association of the language of “constituting objects” with structuralist and poststructuralist theory was unavoidable even for the best-intentioned and most sympathetic reader.
Thr potentially legitimate identification by readers of troping as consonant with a “linguistic turn” approach to the reality of the past was strongly reinforced by White's own analogizing of the process to other forms of consciousness and cognition. To begin with, and on the most fundamental level, White's use of Vico and the explicit grounding of his theory of tropes in Vico's formulation of them clearly placed tropes at the level of figures of thought and modes of historical consciousness, a position far too well known to require rehearsal here. But White did not rest there. At various points he compared the operation of Vico's four tropes to the processes of dreamwork identified by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams, suggesting that they operated at a level so deep as to be unconscious.24 Similarly, the comparison to Jean Piaget's stages of cognitive growth in children equally located them on a deep level of modes of perception and comprehension, since as cognitive stages in the child's maturation, they were beyond the child's conscious control.25 But perhaps the most compelling source of confusion derived from White's identification, in his essay “Foucault Decoded,” of epistemic regimes with Vico's tropes.26 For if Foucauldian épistèmes were essentially, as White argued, forms of Vico's “master” tropes, then did the equation not run both ways, and were not tropes essentially kinds of epistemes?27 And if this were true, did tropes not operate in precisely the way that Foucault explained the workings of epistemic regimes, that is, as composed of fundamental “codes of culture… that establish for every man the empirical order with which he will be dealing.” Such codes, according to Foucault, formed the “mental grids” with which people processed information and thus lived their lives, constituting individual perception as an effect of what Foucault called “the already encoded eye.”28 Or, as White himself put it in that essay, language and the poetic act of representation determine “the very contents of perception.”29 In that sense, the tropes, for White, may be conventional in their intrinsic nature, but they appeared to be structural in the way that they functioned as mental operations.30
White repeatedly shied away from these implications, asserting forthrightly, in Figural Realism, for example, that “there is nothing in the theory implying linguistic determinism or relativism. Tropology is a theory of discourse, not of mind or consciousness. Nor does it suggest that perception is determined by language” (but see above). Similarly: “Tropology does not deny the existence of extra-discursive entities, or our capacity to refer to and represent them in
178
Philosophy of History After Hayden White
speech. It does not suggest that everything is language, speech, discourse or text, only that linguistic referentiality and representation are much more complicated matters than the older literalist notions of language and discourse made out.”31 But such defensive rhetoric in 1999, while wholly compatible with White's early and perduring insistence on human freedom—including the freedom to choose one's own past, as he says at one point—probably came too late for most historians, who had focused on the prefiguring function of tropes. In that sense, the rhetorical verve of the earlier articulations of his narrative and discursive theories worked against a clear understanding of his theory of rhetoric. From this perspective, White's efforts to retain the integrity of the literal and extra-discursive begins to look like an attempt to save the phenomenological along with the phenomena.
The consequences of White's notion of tropes as deep structures (if such it was), understood in a more or less structuralist sense for the status of facts, “data,” the “historical record,” and so on, are too obvious to describe here. Not surprisingly, therefore, the ambiguities in White's articulation of his position and of its reception came to a head in the 1992 conference organized by Saul Friedlander at the University of California, Los Angeles on “Probing the Limits of Representation,” with the central question being how to write the Holocaust. Here, the relativism inevitably stemming from White's insistence on the inevitability of formalist choices in the representation of the past came up against the quasi-sacred character of the Holocaust and the perceived need to preserve it from willful misrepresentation and, at the limit, revisionism, or what the French more aptly term négationisme. The Holocaust was, as White himself had earlier acknowledged, “the bottom line of the politics of interpretation, which informs not only historical studies but the human and social sciences in general.”32
To understand the rather tortuous path that White sought to tread through the question of representing the Holocaust, it helps, I think, to recall that 1992 was a moment when revisionism in France and elsewhere was at its height, as was the corresponding effort to preserve the memory of the Holocaust and its testamentary transmission, at a time when the generation that experienced it, and hence served as the keepers of its memory, was approaching its demise. It was also a moment when concern with the Holocaust was at its peak, after decades of silence broken first only in the mid-sixties.33 There was, therefore, a sense of urgency about preserving a literal record of the catastrophe, lest it slip into oblivion or be delivered into the hands of the revisionists. At bottom, the question turned on whether or not the representation of the Holocaust should be allowed to be “normalized,” hence subject to the routine sorts of
Rhetorical Theory/Theoretical Rhetoric
179
reinterpretation that historical work always entails. It was as much against the “normalization” of the Holocaust as against its denial that scholars like Berel Lang struggled, although in my view unrealistically, to establish and preserve a wholly literal, non-aestheticized account of the event.
White's response to the charge of relativism was, I think, entirely forthright and appropriate, in his continued insistence that “there is a certain inexpugnable relativity in every representation of historical phenomena. The relativity of the representation is a function of the language used to describe and thereby constitute past events as possible objects of explanation and understanding.”34 Thus, as White had already asserted in 1975, “there can be no such thing as a non-relativistic representation of reality, inasmuch as every account of the past is mediated by the language mode in which the historian casts his original description of the historical field.”35 Relativism, in any case, had ceased to be a genuine problem for historians as long ago as Carl Becker's well-known presidential address, “Everyman His Own Historian,” to the American Historical Association in 1931,36 and it had been clearly laid to rest in the presidential address of 1969 by C. Vann Woodward, who proclaimed with lapidary clarity that “if physicists could live with relativity, historians could live with relativism.”37
Equally consistent was White's fidelity to the notion that the Holocaust could be represented and that, in the end, there were no grounds for necessarily preferring one mode of troping and emplotting its representation over another, other than a certain sense of appropriateness (decorum) or “elective affinity.” But, in order to mitigate the seemingly unabashed, if “responsible relativism” (in Ewa Domanska's felicitous phrasing)38 of his position, White, in an attempt to meet the rather stringent demands from participants in the conference for a non- or minimally narrativized account of the Holocaust, had recourse to the idea of the “middle voice” and recommended a modernist version of “intransitive writing” to avoid the problem of unseemly aestheticization. To those familiar with his work, this appeared to be a retreat from the most basic positions that he had earlier set forth about the nature of historical representation as necessarily figural, in that it held out the conceptual possibility of a sort of denarrativized (literalist) historical account along the lines Berel Lang advocated (and Lang certainly understood it as such in his response to Hans Kellner, Wulf Kansteiner, and Robert Braun in the Forum, “Representing the Holocaust”).39 But also, I think, it did not work even on its own terms.
Leaving aside the fact that in Greek there are five grammatical forms of the “middle voice”40 and that English has none, the notion that events could “speak for themselves” seemed particularly unconvincing, coming, as it did,
180
Philosophy of History After Hayden White
from someone who had repeatedly indicated that history, past events, and the facts “do not speak for themselves” and that “stories are not lived, they are told,” are invented, not found. And, of course, if tropes are structural and not merely conventional, then the notion of unmediated access to a past, which in turn presents itself in literal form in the historian's account, is a conceptual impossibility. Notably, White himself insisted at the end of the essay that he did not think that the Holocaust “is any more unrepresentable than any other event in human history,”41 only that it required a new, modernist style for its representation.
However, all the examples that White adduced of the kind of modernist narrative that he had in mind were those of modernist—or, in the case of Derrida, postmodernist—authors, the point being that, whatever their specific character, they were produced by writers. But in the absence of an author, and assuming a narrative other than that of the transcript of a survivor's memories, who, or what, writes the Holocaust? To suggest, in this context, that the events might write themselves was, in effect, to endow them with Logos, and thus to sacralize them in a way that might not disturb Lang, but surely runs counter to everything White believes as a historian.
In this, whether intentionally or not, White's position was aligned with that of scholars like Shoshana Felman, Dori Laub, and Cathy Caruth who at the time were working on Holocaust “traumatic” memory, but with the crucial difference that he was talking about historians and their narratives and not survivors and their testimony.42 His effort thus participated in what, at that moment, I believed was a strenuous effort to recuperate “presence” after the “linguistic turn,” although White himself has always denied access to presence when dealing with the past, a position he reiterated as recently as February 2009 in a published conversation with Erlend Rogne.43 In this connection, it is perhaps apposite to recall that Claude Lanzmann (often invoked in this context as offering an exemplar of the kind of “distanced realism” that Friedlander, among others, thought desirable for the representation of the Holocaust),44 explicitly maintained that “the purpose of the [film] Shoah is not to transmit knowledge,”45 and characterized the film as an “incarnation, a resurrection.” And to underscore this return of presence via resurrection and reincarnation, it is noteworthy that, in a passage far less often cited, Lanzmann asserted that the film is no more memory than history: “The film was not made with memories, I knew it immediately. Memory horrifies me; memory is weak. The film is the destruction of all distance between past and present.”46 Such a destruction of the distance between past and present would, in fact, achieve in historical writing
Rhetorical Theory/Theoretical Rhetoric
181
the effect of Barthes's notion of intransitive writing as that which “denies the distances among the writer, text, what is written about, and finally the reader,”47 but it presupposes the ability to resurrect the past and make it live in the present, a characteristic of Jewish liturgical and commemorative practices, but hardly tenable in relation to modern, or even modernist, historiography. To the extent that the “middle voice,” as the grammatical instrument of “intransitive writing,” participates in this complex of reasoning, one is tempted to say with Nietzsche: “I am afraid we have not got rid of God because we still have faith in grammar.”48
One could easily identify other domains where similar sorts of ambiguity reign in White's work, the most important of which would be the changing meaning of “prefiguration,” which initially referred to the action of language and troping in casting the shape of the historian's perceptions and modes of narration, but came, in White's later work, to be synonymous with the kind of typological relationships established, initially in Biblical exegesis, to link together Old and New Testament figures and events. In Figural Realism White deploys typology—or figuralism—to establish retrospective forms of filiation between earlier and later events, much as medieval exegetes proclaimed Old Testament figures to be types, and in some special sense determinants, of their later New Testament fulfillments. In typological, or figural, exegesis, an earlier event, analogous to the later, becomes a foreshadowing of it, a ‘‘type” of the later.49 Thus just as Jonah in the belly of the whale prefigures the three days of Christ's entombment before the resurrection, so do David, Constantine, and other exemplary heroes of the past “prefigure” and shape the meaning of a Charlemagne, who is a “new David,” a “new Constantine,” or the realization of some other figural complex. By means of typological interpretation in medieval historical writing, the significance of the past is reaffirmed for the present; the old becomes a prophecy of the new and its predeterminant, in the sense that its very existence determines the shape and interpretation of what comes later. In this way, the past becomes an explanatory principle, a way of ordering and making intelligible a relationship between events separated by vast distances of time.
This is precisely the way that White has described the structure of “emplotment” in historical writing:
It is the fulfilled figure that casts its light back—retrospectively and, in the narrative account retroactively—on the earlier figurations of the character or process being related. It is the figure-fulfillment model of narrativity that lends credence to the commonplace that the historian is a prophet, but one who prophesies “backward.” It is what justified the notion that the historian,
182
Philosophy of History After Hayden White
as against the historical characters he studies, occupies a privileged place of knowledge in virtue of the fact that, coming after a given set of events have run their course, “he knows how events actually turned out.”50
But as Erich Auerbach makes clear in his important essay “Figura,” in Scenes from the Drama of European Literature,51 the “truth” established by identifying such relationships between earlier and later figures and events is guaranteed by God, who stands outside of time and crafts its structure, movement, and meaning. For medieval exegetes, the essential relationship between past and present is not strictly linear, but interpretive and figural, passing through God to find its final realization and achievement. To be sure, White is clear that he intends “fulfillment” to be understood “on the analogy of a specifically aesthetic rather than a theological model of figuralism.”52 Yet it remains the case that when White adopts figural reasoning to explain the prefiguring force of relations between past and later eras as that of “fulfillment,” he is secularizing typological notions of the relationship between figures and events separated by centuries in a way that, I suspect, few contemporary historians would understand or accept. For the notion of “fulfillment” suggests that an earlier event/person/type in some (perhaps only “figural”) sense causes its much later, distanced realization, hence bypassing immediate local contexts as principles of explanation. To adopt White's notion of figural fulfillment, then, would entail abandoning the most basic modes of contemporary historical reasoning about causation.53 At the very least, seen from the perspective of White's own body of work, it certainly displaces “prefiguration” from a mode of linguistic and literary activity on the part of the historian to one inherent in the course of history itself.
So where does all this ambiguity leave us in identifying where White belongs as a theorist of historiographical narratives and history? In light of his lifelong embrace of the historical sublime and deeply moral concerns for human freedom, I think I would be tempted to locate him among, or at least alongside, those “eschatological structuralists”—Lévi-Strauss, Barthes, Foucault—who, as he wrote, “concentrate on the ways in which structures of consciousness actually conceal the reality of the world.”54 Like them, he, too, I suspect, is prone to take seriously Mallarmé's conviction that things “exist in order to live in books” and sees historical narrative as that place where the “Flesh is made word.”
