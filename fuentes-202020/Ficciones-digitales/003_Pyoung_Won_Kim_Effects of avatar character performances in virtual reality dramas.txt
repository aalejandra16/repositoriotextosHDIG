ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Virtual reality drama has the benefit of enhancing immersion, which was lacking in original
e-Learning systems. Moreover, dangerous and expensive educational content can be replaced by
stimulating users’ interest. In this study, we investigate the effects of avatar performance in
virtual reality drama. The hypothesis that the psychical distance between virtual characters and
their viewers changes according to the size of video shots is tested with an autonomic nervous
system function test. Eighty-four college students were randomly assigned to three groups.
Virtual reality drama is used to train teachers concerning school bullying prevention, and deals
with the dialogue between teachers and students. Group 1 was provided with full-shot video
clips, Group 2 was shown various clips from full shots to extreme close-ups, and Group 3 was
provided with close-up shots. We found that the virtual reality drama viewers’ levels of
stimulation changed in relation to the size of the shots. The R-R (between P wave and P wave)
intervals of the electrocardiograms (ECGs, bio-signal feedback) became significantly narrower as
the shot size became smaller.

1. Introduction
Currently, virtual reality is actively used in e-learning or
in the field of teachers’ education. Educational department students are able to train using mock students in
simulated situations in virtual drama classrooms. The
effects of avatar characters’ demonstrations in virtual
worlds have a crucial influence on people as well as on
social communication in the real world (Banakou and
Chorianopoulos 2010). Virtual reality drama has the
benefit of enhancing immersion, which was lacking in
original e-learning systems (Andrea et al. 2009). Dangerous and expensive educational content can be replaced
by stimulating users’ interests. In this study, we investigate the effects of avatar performances in virtual reality
dramas (Figure 1).
In plays, the audience decides the direction of their
gaze and the field of view for themselves; however, in
screen dramas, they have no choice but to follow the
view the director composes. Therefore, the director controls the production, expecting the viewers to recognise
the vision he intended. Zettle provides a manual that
shows how to apply major aesthetic elements to manipulate people’s perception (Zettle 1998). The director constructs scenes with the aesthetic foundation that comes
from his experience, but often this basis cannot be

explained clearly. This is related to the lack of a basis
for objectively judging the viewers’ accommodation of
the scenes. Previous studies on television viewers’ levels
of stimulation while controlling different variables theorise on this basis (Mattes and Cantor 1982; Lang et al.
2000; Angelini 2008).
There are several methods of assessing viewers’ levels
of stimulation: observation of behaviour, self-reporting,
measurement of biofeedback, or interviewing subjects.
Bio-signals tracked with electroencephalograms, electrocardiography, functional magnetic resonance imaging,
or blood pressure monitoring can reflect objective findings (Figure 2).
Bio-signals have mostly been extensively investigated
in the fields of physiology and engineering. Stimulation
is associated with physiological changes, such as an
increase in heart rate, perspiration, muscle tension, or
rapid respiration (Barlow 2001). As stimulation heightens, sympathetic discharge in the nervous system is
activated. As the blood supply to the heart increases,
blood flow in the digestive system decreases, resulting
in diarrhoea or constipation (Fox 2008). Arousal influences the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and is
associated with physiological changes in the body
(Figure 3).

These responses enable stimulation to be expressed in
specific bio-signals, as well as in signals that reflect the
index of stimulation. In the areas of broadcasting and
communication, the methods measuring heart rate or
skin conductance are generally used (Ravaja 2004;
Lang et al. 2005) as well as facial expression changes captured using video analysis (Andreoni et al. 2006). For
instance, facial expression changes as reaction to a
specific stimulus (e.g. codified as Facial Action Coding
System (FACS; Ekman and Erika 1997)) allow to infer
the emotional feeling of a given subject (Anisetti and
Bellandi 2009; Ghanem and Caplier 2013).
An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the periodic
electrical activity of the heart. Clinically, ECGs are used
to detect wave abnormalities that indicate cardiac dysfunction. For example, QRS reflects ventricular contraction when blood is pumping out of the ventricle into the
aorta. The ‘ST segment’, which is between the QRS and T

waves, is depressed in patients with angina. In addition
to the clinical use of wave abnormalities, the variability
in R-R intervals has been demonstrated to provide
a heart rate calculation. The R-R interval is the time
elapse between two consecutive R waves in an ECG
(Figure 4).
An ECG provides electrophysiological data in a
time-dependent manner with factors composed of electrical waves. In order to select appropriate data for this
study, we attempted to determine the degree of virtual
reality drama viewers’ stimulation by focusing on the
analysis of R-R intervals, rather than centring on spectra or times-series analysis. Such an approach can provide sympathetic monitoring of the body, resulting in
an interpretation of the ANS that expresses the stimulation status (Sinji 2004; Yang et al. 2009).1 The
remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section
2 underlines the research hypotheses. Section 3

subjects, the protocol adopted, and the materials used

conclusions.

2. Research hypotheses
The size of a shot means how far or close we perceive an
object or a person appearing on screen to be (Zettle
1998). In other words, it is not only a matter of placing
an object of a certain size, but it also delivers the

circumstances of the frame that the object is in. The
long shot, exposing a broad range, is used as an establishing shot, which shows the place and time as well as the
relationship of the location to the objects. Compared
with the long shot, the full shot gives an opportunity to
recognise, to some degree, the character of a person
along with spatial information. The medium shot focuses
more on the character of the person by explaining a circumstance, but it still gives information on the space and
other characters (Figure 5).
However, the medium close-up shot (bust shot) and
the close-up shot are appropriate when describing
specific details (Figure 6), such as facial expressions,

while excluding spatial information (Arijon 1976;
Monaco 1981; Millerson 1985; Bordwell and Kristin
1993). In movies and dramas, the classification of
these shots is more delicately defined and used with the
consideration of the flow of emotions. Generally, the
definition methods for shots are classified according
to how much focus is rendered on a character, while
the standard for close-up shots differs from country to
country (Zettle 1998).
In this study, the hypothesis that the psychical distance between characters and viewers can be changed
according to the size of shots is confirmed by an
ANS function test. A real-time bio-signal measurement
was applied to analyse the phenomenon of media
accommodation. The measurement of R-R intervals
from ECGs was carefully used when analysing viewers’
levels of stimulation. The hypotheses of this study are
as follows:
H1: The response of a viewer’s ANS is significantly
different according to the size of the shot.
H2: The self-reporting method of viewers’ levels of
stimulation and the ANS function test will show a
difference.
H3: The response of viewers’ ANS will vary between
male and female according to the size of the shot.
H4: The response of the ANS will be different according
to the scenes from a virtual reality drama.

3. Method
3.1. Subjects
Eighty-four university students (42 males, 42 females)
took part in this experiment (μ = 22.6 years old, σ =
2.66, range = 17−28). ECG measurements were taken
while they listened to classical music or watched video
clips for 10 min in return for a free meal pass. They
were randomly divided into three groups (n = 28, 29,
27). The difference in the sample size from the original
sample was due to the fact that in the beginning each
of the three groups comprised 30 students, that is, a
total of 90 participants, but six students were excluded
from the experiment because of clinical abnormalities
revealed by their ECGs. All subjects participated voluntarily and signed consent forms.
3.2. Experimental protocol
The overall study design was a randomised control
group. In line with the hypothesis, the subjects were
divided into three groups. This was meant to control
the carryover effect, which brought disadvantages within
the subject design. ECGs were measured after the participants listened to the same stimulus – classical music.
More ECGs were then measured while each group was
shown virtual reality drama video clips of the same content but with different shot sizes (Figure 7).

After measurement, the checklists evaluating the level
of the participants’ stimulation were collected. Protocols
for the procedure were in compliance with the guidelines
set by the institutional review committee of KoNIBP
(Korea National Institute for Bioethics Policy).
3.3. Stimulus materials
To generate stimulation, the subjects were shown virtual
reality drama productions. These were created using
StoryBoard Artist 7 (storyboard software, USA) and were
based on scenes from School 2013 – a drama, a Korean
Broadcasting System production. This series focuses on
portraying the concerns, struggles, and dilemmas of
today’s youth. It is a story about Seungri High, a troublesome school that houses students from the most eligible
to the most problematic. School 2013 shows the different
life stories of teachers and students as they emerge from
conflicts and compromises. As the university students
had varied interests and background knowledge, episodes based on a school allowed the control of the content variables and enabled the participants to relate to
the characters. After a preliminary survey, four scenes
that evoked the most sympathy out of all the scenes containing teacher–student conflicts were chosen for study.
The selected four scenes were evenly allotted to both genders (Table 1). Twenty-three pretest subjects who did not
participate in the study evaluated all the scenes. The
selected scenes were similar to the teacher–student conflicts depicted in the American drama series Glee (2009)
and Awkward (2011) (see Appendix).

To produce the selected scenes in three versions with
different shot sizes, four professional actors practised
for two weeks; then the scenes were filmed in a studio.
The actors consented to their pictures and videos being
used for research purposes. The first video (Source 1 in
Figure 3) was filmed and edited in full shot. The second
video (Source 2 in Figure 3) was filmed in full shot at the
beginning, cross-filmed, and then finished with an
extreme close-up. In the third video (Source 3 in
Figure 3), only the first scene, which was the establishing
shot, was filmed in full shot, and the rest was crossfilmed in close-up until the end (Figure 8).

4. Measurement and data analysis
4.1. ECG data collection
For the ECG analysis, a QECG-3® (Quantitative Electrocardiography-three Limb Lead, LXC3203®, Daejeon,
Korea) model was used. The standard three limb leads
(Lead I, Lead II, and Lead III) were applied according
to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The subjects
were asked to sit. While in a resting state, they listened
to classical music for 5 min and then watched four
video scenes for 5 min while the ECG electrode sensors
were attached. Real-time ECG values were monitored
and displayed by this system.

4.2. Assessment of stimulation levels
After ECG data collection, the subjects were given a
checklist for self-reporting the level of effect the characters had on them. The subjects were asked to record the
level of effect that the male and female students, and the
male and female teachers had on them, on a scale from 1
(not agitated at all) to 10 (extremely agitated).

4.3. R-R interval profile (tachogram) analysis
Stimulation levels were evaluated using the mean values
of the R-R interval variability. When the ECG data were
converted into a graph that showed the changes in the
R-R interval, the R-R interval profile (R-R interval

tendency of evaluating the stimulation effects of the
characters was consistent in Group 1, which was
shown video clips filmed in full shots; Group 2, which
was shown video clips filmed in various shots; and
Group 3, which was shown video clips recorded in
close-up shots. However, the difference among the
groups in four characters was not statistically significant
(Table 4). There was no significant difference between
males and females within the groups (Table 5).

tachogram) could be displayed. Shortening of the R-R
interval could be interpreted as the activation of sympathetic activity. It was also associated with the person
immersed in the drama being in an excited state (Figure
9 (a)). In contrast, a longer R-R interval represented the
activation of parasympathetic activity and was associated
with a relaxed condition (Figure 9 (b)).
4.4. Statistical analysis
The mean values of the R-R interval that changed in
seconds were constructed for the GLM (General Linear
Model) repeated measures procedure. The baseline
characteristics of the three groups were compared
using one-way ANOVAs and independent t-tests. The
effects were statistically analysed by comparing the
mean of the R-R intervals with the repeated measures
ANOVAs. To measure the effect size, an h2 was used.
A p-value below .05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.

5.3. Analysis of the groups’ change through R-R
intervals
Figure 11 shows the difference in the mean value of R-R
intervals among the three groups (*p < .05, ***p < .001).
Figure 12 shows a time-series plot per second of the
change in the mean value of R-R intervals within the
groups while watching Scene 1 (a 62-second video clip
on a conflict between a male teacher and a female student). As a result of conducting repeated measures
ANOVAs in order to analyse the difference among the
groups, the between-subject effects of R-R intervals
were not significant (F[2, 4941] = 2.872, p = .062,
h2 = .066). Based on a p-value below .05, there was no
significant difference, but considering the eta squared
there was about a medium-sized effect. There was a slight
tendency for the viewers’ R-R intervals to narrow as the
size of a shot got smaller. The interactions between the
time and group of effects were not significant (F[2,
4941] = .676, p = .997, h2 = .016). This implied that
there was no difference in the pattern of the change in
R-R intervals among the groups according to the passage
of time. The within-subject effects were not significant
(F[2, 4941] = .707, p = .959, h2 = .009). This showed
that there was no difference in the pattern of the changes
in R-R intervals within the groups according to the
passage of time.
Figure 13 shows a time-series plot per second of the
change in the mean value of R-R intervals within the
groups while watching Scene 2 (a 41-second video clip
on a conflict between a male student and a male teacher).
As a result of conducting repeated measures ANOVAs in
order to analyse the difference among the groups, one
can see that the between-subject effect of R-R intervals

5. Results
5.1. Pretest homogeneity
First, to confirm that there was no significant difference
among the groups on the same stimulus, an ANOVA was
performed on the R-R interval while subjects were listening to classical music. As a result, there was no significant
difference in R-R intervals among the three groups
(Group 1 [n = 28, μ = 0.7984, σ = 0.060], Group 2 [n =
29, μ = 0.7858, σ = 0.738], and Group 3 [n = 27, μ =
0.7924, σ = 0.141]) (Tables 2 and 3).

was significant (F[2, 3240] = 3.451, p = .036, h2 = .079).
There was a tendency for the viewers’ R-R interval to
narrow as the size of a shot got smaller, and there was
about a medium-sized effect. The interactions between

the time and group of effect were significant (F[2,
3240] = 1.656, p = .000, h2 = .039). As a result of conducting a t-test revising significance levels by using
Bonferroni’s method to check at what point in time the
interactions took place, the difference between Groups
2 and 3 became similar after 20 seconds. The result
from Group 1 after 20 seconds resembled that of
Group 2 because of the male student’s line that revealed
his dramatic resistance towards the male teacher. The
within-subject effects were not significant (F[2, 3240]
= .722, p = .903, h2 = .009).
Figure 14 shows a partial time-series plot per second
of the change in the mean value of R-R intervals within

teacher). As a result of conducting repeated measures

groups, the between-subject effect of the R-R intervals
was significant (F[2, 4212] = 4.254, p = .000, h2 = .095),
but the interactions between the time and group of
effects were not significant (F[2, 4212] = .755, p = .970,
h2 = .018). The within-subject effects were not significant as well (F[2, 4212] = 1.472, p = .016, h2 = 0.018).
The difference in gender within the group was significant in Group 3 watching Scenes 2 and 3 (Table 6). Due
to the conflicts between a male student and a male teacher and between a female student and a female teacher,
the female subjects’ levels of stimulation became intense
(μ = 0.7378, σ = 0.07944; μ = 0.7376, σ = 0.07862).

6. Discussion and conclusion
Recently, virtual reality classrooms and virtual reality
drama have been used for E-learning and teacher training. Education students are able to hone their skills in
front of almost life-like students (Hu, Wu, and Shieh
2016). The situations in virtual reality classrooms
could provide the teachers with the situated teaching
method.
This study confirms how viewers perceived the same
scenes filmed with different shot sizes. As a result of providing the same virtual reality drama scenes with different shot sizes to three different groups, changes in the
ANS corresponding to changes in the shot size were
found to be highly relevant. Except for Scene 1, the
between-subject effects were significant. One can conclude that as the size of the shot decreased, the viewers’
R-R intervals in the ECGs tended to get narrower. This
result strongly supports Hypothesis 1, which states that
the response of a viewer’s ANS would be significantly
different according to the size of the shot. As this result
differed from the self-reporting method measured on the
10-point scale, Hypothesis 2, which states that the selfreporting method on viewers’ level of stimulation and
the methods of the ANS function test would show a
difference, is clearly proven. The testing of physiological
reactions was more appropriate to studying the viewers’
levels of stimulation than the verbal reports, as there
were less cultural differences and it was less affected by
reasonable judgement.
The difference in gender within each group was statistically significant only in Group 3, who saw the scenes
filmed in close-up. The results showed that the female
participants tended to absorb the characters’ emotions
more than the male participants when the psychological
distance reached the close-up shots. Therefore, Hypothesis 3, which stated that the response in viewers’ ANS
would vary from male to female according to shot size,
should be dismissed. This also implies that the size of a

11

shot was more important than the content of the video
based on gender.
For all the scenes, the within-subject effects were not significant.
This showed that there was no difference in the R-R interval
change pattern within the groups over time. Except for Scene 2,
the interaction between time and group was not significant.
From this, we can also conclude that there was no difference in
the R-R interval change patterns within the groups over time.
Therefore, Hypothesis 4, which states that the response of the
ANS would be different according to the scenes in a virtual reality
drama, should be dismissed. This also implies that shot size was
more important than the content of the video.
As shot size decreased, the R-R intervals in the ECGs
tended to get narrower. It was observed statistically that
the R-R intervals in the ECGs tended to get wider as the
shot size increased. This result also implies that shot size
is proportional to the viewers’ psychological distance for
recognising it. As the shot size got narrower, the psychological distance between the viewer and the characters
got closer, and vice versa.
The concept of distance used in various academic
fields refers to aesthetic distance in aesthetics and psychical distance in theories of fiction. The aesthetic distance
means effectively controlling the subject’s view on the
object (Sherburne 1961). In other words, it is related to
how far the distance has to be for the object’s substance
to be revealed (Bullough 1912). In novels, the distance
refers to the author’s psychical or emotional distance
from the object (Booth 1961). The author may be more
or less distant from the character. As in novels, various
methods are used in virtual reality drama to adjust the
distance between the characters and the viewers. This
study proves that, based on their bio-signal measurements, there is a change in viewers’ perception depending on the size of the shot.
The method evaluating the participants’ levels of
stimulation after watching the video clips did not show
differences among the groups, but the real-time biosignal measurements while watching the scenes were
statistically significant. The difference in this work
compared with previous studies is that it provides visualisations of objective data using ECG recordings. The
analysis of R-R intervals could be regarded as a method
of neurocommunication, similar to neurocinematics,
which analyses the viewers’ state of mind as it instantly
monitors dynamic emotional states (Hasson et al. 2008).2
So far, video clip editing has been under the director’s
autonomy. However, if editing is to immerse the audience in the natural narrative, it needs to adopt technology which analyses the viewer’s psychological distance
according to changes in the audience’s ANS and reflects
it in the edit. The smaller the shot size, the greater the
level of identification between the audience and the

actor. For the same size shot, the over-the-shoulder shot
maintains the psychical distance between characters and
viewers to a certain degree. This tells us which characters
are most important in a scene or at a particular point in
the narrative. The set of scales defined in this study are
shown in Figure 16.
This study has several limitations. First, the number of
participants was small. More samples were needed in
order to reach a conclusion regarding gender difference
in accommodating the video (Angelini 2008). This
would have made it possible to offer generalisations.
Additionally, further research applying this method to
various scenes that do not involve conversations is
required. For example, results from similar studies with
scenes using the ‘charade method’, not conversational
scenes, should be examined.
In conclusion, the psychical distance between the
viewers and virtual reality drama characters was related
to shot size, and producers could control the psychical
distance by adjusting the shot size.

Notes
1. A heart rate is defined as beats per minute and corresponds to the number of R-R intervals per minute.
Measuring R-R intervals has an advantage of monitoring the dynamic emotional state instantly compared to
measuring the heart rate, which estimates the average
number of R-R intervals per minute.
2. Neurocommunication research uses technologies such as
fMRI to measure changes in activity in parts of the brain,
electroencephalography to measure activity in specific
regional spectra of brain response, and/or sensors to
measure changes in viewers’ physiological states to learn
exactly what message excites or disinterests the viewer.
