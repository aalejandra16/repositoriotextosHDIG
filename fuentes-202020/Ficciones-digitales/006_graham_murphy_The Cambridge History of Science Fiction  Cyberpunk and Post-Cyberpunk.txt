Cyberpunk and Post-Cyberpunk
graham j. murphy

Cyberpunk emerged in the early to mid-1980s initially to describe a cadre of
authors whose thematic interests and narrative motifs were strikingly similar.
The term originated with Bruce Bethke’s short story “Cyberpunk” (1983) and
was bestowed by editor Gardner Dozois onto the early ﬁctions of William
Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Rudy Rucker, John Shirley, and Lewis Shiner,
although later entrants into the cyberpunk pantheon soon appeared.
Cyberpunk marries the cyber- of cybernetics with the countercultural punk
attitude of the 1970s, and this attitude is evident in the at-times tempestuous
attitude cyberpunks had towards earlier SF. For example, Bruce Sterling
edited the Cheap Truth fanzine in the earliest days of the Movement, as
cyberpunk was initially known, and in his nom de plume “Vincent
Omniaveritas” he sketched out cyberpunk’s countercultural attitude:
“Extrapolations, that once held some intellectual validity, have now become
distorted folk tales, passed down through generations. SF’s vision of the
future has become a Punch and Judy show, ritualized, predictable, and only
ﬁt for children.”1 Or, “Sue Denim,” aka Lewis Shiner, pitted the young
upstarts against the establishment in his speculations on the 1985 Nebula
Awards: “The voices of repression range from the senile babblings of Robert
Heinlein to the California vapidity of Larry Niven to the moist-eyed urgency
of Kim Stanley Robinson; arrayed against them are William Gibson, Lewis
Shiner, and Jack Dann . . . For every Heinlein that smites a Gibson, thousands
more will rise in his place. The SF revolution is crying out for literacy,
imagination, and humanity; it needs only a victory in the Nebulas to shatter
the giant’s terracotta feet. Up against the wall, Heinlein!”2

It was this punk attitude that energized cyberpunk; after all, cyberpunk’s
literary motifs certainly didn’t originate in the eighties. Cyberpunk’s genetic
imprint can be found in such diverse offerings as Samuel Delany’s Nova
(1968), Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968), Joanna
Russ’s “When It Changed” (1972) and The Female Man (1975), Thomas
Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow (1973), James Tiptree, Jr.’s “The Girl Who Was
Plugged In” (1973), John Brunner’s The Shockwave Rider (1975), John Varley’s
“Overdrawn at the Memory Bank” (1976), among others. Nevertheless,
stories such as Gibson’s “The Gernsback Continuum” (1981) embody the
revolutionary punk swagger. The story follows an American photojournalist
hired to photograph the architectural remnants of a never-realized future,
a “1980s that never happened. An architecture of broken dreams.”3 When the
photographer begins seeing visions of an alternate America, he goes to Merv
Kihn, who explains he is witnessing “semiotic phantoms, bits of deep cultural
imagery that have split off and taken on a life of their own.”4 One such vision
is of a white, blond, and likely blue-eyed American family standing in front of
a futuristic city common to SF of earlier decades, prompting the narrator to
recall, “It had all the sinister fruitiness of Hitler Youth propaganda.”5 In one
deft sentence, Gibson’s story efﬁciently dismisses Golden Age visions of the
future as akin to Hitler Youth propaganda, and it is these extrapolations that
were vociferously rejected by cyberpunk.
Gibson gave the ﬂedgling movement its gravitational locus and Sterling
sets the scene in the documentary No Maps for These Territories (dir. Mark
Neale, 2000): “When Lewis Shiner and I . . . were ﬁrst reading Gibson’s work
in manuscript, we looked at it and said ‘Look, this is breakthrough material.
This guy is really doing something different. Like we gotta put down our
preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver. It’s the way
forward.’ A hole had opened up in consensus reality and we just saw daylight.” Gibson’s ﬁrst novel, Neuromancer (1984), begins a trilogy that continues
with Count Zero (1986), and Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988). The story follows
Henry Dorsett Case, a crippled computer hacker who is recruited by the
cyborg assassin Molly Millions, whom we’ve earlier encountered in “Johnny
Mnemonic” (1981). The duo teams with the psychologically damaged
Armitage and sociopathic Peter Riviera to pull off a series of heists for
a mysterious employer. Neuromancer is in part modeled upon the hard3

boiled detective ﬁctions of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, so
Gibson’s near-future is not only awash with diverse, often illicit, technologies
but also told from the street-level of hustlers, criminals, and opportunists,
a familiar narrative topos that Gibson expertly crafted in such stories as
“Johnny Mnemonic,” “Burning Chrome” (1982),6 “New Rose Hotel” (1984),
and “The Winter Market” (1985). In the end, “Sue Denim” witnessed the
Nebula victory he longed for in his Cheap Truth editorial: Neuromancer won
the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel, as it did the 1985 Hugo Award and the
1984 Philip K. Dick Award, the ﬁrst (and only) time one book has won all
three awards.
A signiﬁcant problem for early cyberpunk, however, was Gibson’s success:
the popularity of his narrative vision eclipsed the diversity of cyberpunk’s earliest
practitioners. For example, John Shirley’s City Come A-Walkin’ (1980), published
four years earlier, is tonally similar to Neuromancer, but his Song Called Youth
series – Eclipse (1985), Eclipse Penumbra (1988), and Eclipse Corona (1990) – is more
socio-politically engaged in its exploration of neo-fascism in the techno-digital
age. Lewis Shiner’s Frontera (1984) involves colonizing Mars while Deserted Cities
of the Heart (1988) features mushroom-induced psychedelic visions that involve
time travel to an ancient Mayan age. Rudy Rucker’s Ware tetralogy – Software
(1982), Wetware (1988), Freeware (1997), and Realware (2000) – follows the evolutionary paths of different kinds of robots (‘boppers’), robot–human hybrids
(‘meatbops’), intelligent symbiotes (‘moldies’), and so forth. Bruce Sterling’s
The Artiﬁcial Kid (1980) is set on the distant planet of Reverie where Arti, the
novel’s protagonist, sells videos of himself engaged in bloodsport combat with
his fellow ﬁghters, all for the amusement of the socio-economically privileged
classes. On the other hand, his Schismatrix series – “Swarm” (1982), “Spider Rose”
(1982), “Cicada Queen” (1983), “Sunken Gardens” (1984), “Twenty Evocations”
(1984), and Schismatrix (1985) – takes place over the span of nearly 200 years and is
set in the sprawling Shaper/Mechanist universe, a far-future posthuman era
deﬁned by ongoing conﬂict between the Shapers, who modify their bodies
chieﬂy through genetic modiﬁcations, and the Mechanists, adherents to cybernetic augmentations. Finally, his Islands in the Net (1988) addresses the difﬁculties
of living off the grid and is set in locales largely ignored in cyberpunk, including
Grenada, Singapore, and the African continent.7

“Burning Chrome” coined the term “cyberspace,” which would quickly enter the English
lexicon, although Neuromancer certainly popularized it.

In spite of the initial popularity, there was also an increasing sense that for all
its revolutionary bluster,8 cyberpunk amounted to nothing more than a clever
marketing campaign. After all, as famed SF editor David Hartwell once
remarked in conversation, Sterling brought an idea for a cyberpunk anthology
to Hartwell, who promptly told Sterling he didn’t have enough authors to
assemble a collection. Sterling then went on a recruitment campaign to complete the project, and the release of Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology (1986)
effectively completed the rebranding of the Movement into the easily marketable cyberpunk. It was therefore always a retail category and cyberpunk impersonators and knock-offs quickly cashed in, although such novels as K. W. Jeter’s
The Glass Hammer (1985), Walter Jon Williams’s Hardwired (1986), Robert
Charles Wilson’s Memory Wire (1987), and Mirrorshades alumnus Tom
Maddox’s Halo (1991) were better than most. In any event, Shiner categorically
dismissed later cyberpunk as “sci-ﬁberpunk” in his New York Times editorial
“Confessions of an Ex-Cyberpunk” (1991): “Other writers had turned the form
into formula: implant wetware (biological computer chips), government by
multinational corporations, street-wise, leather-jacketed, amphetamine-loving
protagonists and decayed orbital colonies.”9 It also probably didn’t help that
Sterling’s introductory remarks to Mirrorshades readily packaged cyberpunk:
“Certain central themes spring up repeatedly in cyberpunk. The theme of body
invasion: prosthetic limbs, implanted circuitry, cosmetic surgery, genetic alteration. The even more powerful theme of mind invasion: brain–computer interfaces, artiﬁcial intelligence, neurochemistry – techniques radically redeﬁning the
nature of humanity, the nature of the self.”10 Shiner would not be the ﬁrst
movement-era writer to declare cyberpunk dead. Sterling returned to conduct
his own autopsy for Interzone in “Cyberpunk in the Nineties” (1998): “But today,
it must be admitted that the cyberpunks . . . are no longer a Bohemian underground. This too is an old story in Bohemia; it is the standard punishment for
success. An underground in the light of day is a contradiction in terms.
Respectability does not merely beckon; it actively envelops. And in this sense,
‘cyberpunk’ is even deader than Shiner admits.”11

The revolutionary energy would eventually be substituted with a more “retroﬁt”
outlook. Sterling eventually writes “cyberpunk is in some sense a return to roots,”
chieﬂy acknowledging the importance of 1960s-era authors, including Philip
José Farmer, Alfred Bester, and others. “Preface,” Mirrorshades (New York: Ace Books,
1988), pp. x–xi).

Cyberpunk and Post-Cyberpunk

While literary cyberpunk’s inﬂuence may be open to debate, it has
arguably “been the most relevant and inﬂuential as a visual aesthetic.”12
After all, Neuromancer’s opening line is the visually rich “the sky above the
port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel”;13 or, Pat
Cadigan’s “Pretty Boy Crossover” (1986) features one of its characters,
Bobby, trading his corporeal self for a “pretty boy” digital simulation
where he can perpetually dance on the video screens of the hottest
nightclubs. Given this visual preponderance, it is understandable why
cinematic cyberpunk underwent its own evolution. Its benchmark consists
of a trifecta of titles: TRON (dir. Steven Lisberger, 1982), Blade Runner (dir.
Ridley Scott, 1982), and Videodrome (dir. David Cronenberg, 1983). With its
neon-saturated and polluted urban sprawl, overcrowded streets, futuristic
and anachronistic technologies, and incessant advertising, coupled with
the fact that it is an adaptation of Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep?, Blade Runner is arguably the most inﬂuential cinematic vision of
cyberpunk: Scott Bukatman writes that “cyberpunk provided the image of
the future in the 1980s” and the “aesthetic of cyberpunk was almost
deﬁned by Blade Runner.”14 Videodrome, however, is certainly no pushover:
with its graphic and hallucinatory interrogation of media, mind-control
conspiracies, and techno-organicism, Cronenberg’s bizarre cinematic journey is “the most signiﬁcant sf ﬁlm of the 1980s, and is certainly – and very
early on – the most cyberpunk.”15 Finally, TRON is important in its own
right as the ﬁlm’s depiction of the internal digital space of video games
“set the standards for representing game space and still resonates in the
popular cultural sensibility. With its 90°-angled grid-structure, the overlay
of physical and virtual space, and the dark background lit with neon
circuitry, TRON provided the space beyond the screen with its original
blueprint”.16

It is tempting to argue the revolutionary energy infusing cyberpunk
effectively died by the start of the 1990s, epitomized by Shiner’s eulogy, the
rote sci-ﬁberpunk crowding the bookshelves, the critically panned but marginally successful The Lawnmower Man (dir. Brett Leonard, 1992), the ﬁnancial
and critical failure of Johnny Mnemonic (dir. Robert Longo, 1995), and the
commercial and critical bomb that was Billy Idol’s Cyberpunk (1993), an album
for which Idol admits his “creative instincts and possibly even my taste
seemed to abandon me this time around.”17 At the same time, cyberpunk
was undergoing necessary transformations from its 1980s splendor. For
example, a consistent critique was cyberpunk’s celebration of white, masculinist, heteronormativity that largely ignored the progressive inﬂuence of
1970s-era feminist SF. A 1990s-era feminist inﬂux into cyberpunk produced
Misha’s Red Spider White Web (1990), Marge Piercy’s He, She and It/Body of
Glass (1991), Pat Cadigan’s Synners (1991), Maureen F. McHugh’s China
Mountain Zhang (1992), Laura J. Mixon’s Glass Houses (1992), Mary
Rosenblum’s Chimera (1993), and Melissa Scott’s Trouble and Her Friends
(1994). Cadigan deserves special attention because as the only woman
included in the Mirrorshades anthology, she cemented herself as the Queen
of Cyberpunk with such short stories as “Rock On” (1984), “Pretty Boy
Crossover,” “Roadside Rescue” (1985), and the novel Mindplayers (1987), itself
a ﬁx-up novel comprising “The Pathosﬁnder” (1981), “Nearly Departed”
(1983), “Variation on a Man” (1984), and “Lunatic Bridge” (1987). Synners
deﬁes a quick summary, but the novel features genetic implants, computer
hackers, the commodiﬁcation of dreams, corporate exploitation of burgeoning markets, digital uploads of consciousness, and the evolution of an
artiﬁcial intelligence. Karen Cadora argues Synners subverts “cyberpunk’s
masculinist conventions in important ways,”18 chieﬂy by virtue of implantable sockets that destabilize traditional masculinity: “these cyberpunks plug
wires deep into their own brains. They are the penetrated, not the penetrating. Cadigan’s male cyberpunks are automatically feminized by virtue of
their entry into the matrix.”19
Interestingly, penetration is also central to Scott’s Trouble and Her Friends.
The story follows retired hackers and former lovers Trouble and Cerise as
their tracking of someone impersonating Trouble pulls them back into one
another’s orbit and the hacking domain of Seahaven. What emerges is

a conﬂict between the old-school hackers – white, straight, male, who rely
solely on their manual hacking skills – and the more-recent hackers, who use
implanted brainworm technology to hack digital databases. This new generation of hackers is clearly coded as women, queer, and/or persons of color
and they are dismissed by the old-school hackers for relying on the implanted
“worm” and therefore not being true hackers. In a roundtable discussion at the
International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts, Scott once acknowledged she was annoyed by cyberpunk’s conservatism and wrote Trouble and
Her Friends as an explicit rebuttal to cyberpunk’s white, straight, masculinism.
It clearly resonated with readers: Trouble and Her Friends won the 1995 Lambda
Literary Award for Gay and Lesbian Science Fiction and Fantasy.
While feminist or feminist-oriented cyberpunk may have been altering
literary cyberpunk’s narrative landscapes, Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash
(1992) inherited the cyberpunk crown, joining Gibson’s Neuromancer on
Time magazine’s list of 100 all-time best English-language novels post-1923.
Snow Crash is a sprawling novel that follows pizza deliverer, hacker, and
sword-wielder Hiro Protagonist and courier Y.T. (Yours Truly) as they
navigate both a virtual world called the Metaverse and a balkanized
America whose enclaves are ruled by private organizations, organized religion, and/or the maﬁa. Hiro’s and Y.T.’s skills are put to the test when facing
an info-apocalypse based on a Sumerian ur-language which inﬁltrates the
brain, reduces the user to a babble-spewing shell, and facilitates neurological
reprogramming. The antagonists L. Bob Rife, a Christian fundamentalist, and
Raven, a nuclear-bomb wielding Aleut, distribute the Snow Crash virus
through an addictive drug, tainted blood, and/or a computer program that
attacks hackers and leaves them vulnerable, if not brain dead. In addition to
its ongoing popularity – Variety reported on September 28, 2017 that Amazon
and Paramount Television were developing a Snow Crash adaptation – Snow
Crash continues cyberpunk’s trend of “equating unchecked capitalist relations
with dystopian futures.”20
At the same time literary cyberpunk was undergoing metamorphosis, its
two most prominent ﬁgures – William Gibson and Bruce Sterling – were
again testing their collaborative mettle (following their co-written story “Red
Star, Winter Orbit” [1983]) by travelling into an alternate version of the past
with The Difference Engine (1990). In their co-authored novel, Gibson and
Sterling depict an alternate history in which Charles Babbage has succeeded

in constructing the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine, steampowered computers that radically reshape the direction of the Industrial
Revolution, the British Empire, and the world at large. The Difference Engine
depicts a British Empire that, as a direct result of Babbage’s technological
achievements and Ada Lovelace’s programming skills, is more powerful than
its real-world nineteenth-century counterpart, a vast British North America
(i.e., Canada) that has maintained imperial stability, a then-ﬂedgling United
States that is both fragmented and geo-politically stunted, an Ireland that
never suffered through the Great Famine (1845–9), and plenty of other
alterations to the historical record. As John Clute writes for
The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, The Difference Engine depicts “a cruel and
polluted Dystopia, a land dominated by calculation, measurement and
severely ‘practical’ reason. Vast arterial roads ransack a choking London;
huge masonical ediﬁces house the new totalitarian bureaucracy which operates the Engines; and a conscious AI is a-borning.”21 Nevertheless,
The Difference Engine resonated with readers as it translated cyberpunk’s
obsession with Alvin Tofﬂer’s future shock by projecting the force of technological change into a different epoch. It was nominated for several awards,
including the British Science Fiction Award (1990) and the Nebula Award
(1991), and helped popularize steampunk as a marketable niche within science
ﬁction.
Of course, while The Difference Engine may have popularized this niche
label, steampunk existed prior to Gibson and Sterling’s inﬂuential novel.
In fact, these cyberpunk forefathers arrived well after K. W. Jeter coined
the term steampunk in a letter of April 1987 to Locus to encapsulate alternate
history ﬁctions set amidst the backdrop of an industrial steam-powered era.
This alternate history aesthetic can be carbon-dated to such novels as Jeter’s
Morlock Night (1979) and Infernal Devices (1987), Tim Powers’s The Anubis Gates
(1983), and James P. Blaylock’s Homunculus (1986), although Peter Nicholls
and David Langford’s entry on steampunk for The Encyclopedia of Science
Fiction draws attention to such proto-steampunk novels as Christopher
Priest’s The Space Machine (1976), Michael Moorcock’s The Warlord of the Air
(1971), William Kotzwinkle’s Fata Morgana (1977), John Mella’s
Transformations (1975), and Steven Utley and Howard Waldrop’s “Black as
the Pit, from Pole to Pole” (1977). Following the success of The Difference
Engine, however, steampunk has evolved, even at times eclipsed, cyberpunk’s

contemporaneous development, including Mirrorshades alumnus Paul Di
Filippo’s three novellas – “Victoria” (1991), “Walt and Emily” (1993), and
“Hottentots” (1995) – collected as The Steampunk Trilogy (1995), Ann and Jeff
VanderMeer’s anthologies Steampunk (2008), Steampunk II: Steampunk
Reloaded (2010), and Ann VanderMeer’s Steampunk III: Steampunk Revolution
(2012), and Sean Wallace’s anthology The Mammoth Book of Steampunk (2012),
to name only a sliver of titles from an otherwise voluminous corpus of work.
Nicholls and Langford also draw attention to “China Miéville’s King Rat
(1998), Perdido Street Station (2000) and several later works [that show]
a debt to urban fantasy generally, and Steampunk in its darker aspects” and
YA author Phillip Reeve, “arguably one of the prime movers in what
followed, with at least seven very popular steampunk novels, from Mortal
Engines (2001) to Scrivener’s Moon (2011).”22 And, of course, steampunk wasn’t
restricted to prose: Alan Moore and Kevin O’Neill’s The League of
Extraordinary Gentlemen (1999–2007; 2009–), Joe Kelly and Chris Bachalos’s
Steampunk: Manimatron (2000–2), and Bill Willingham, Sergio Davilla, and Joe
Benitez’s Legenderry: A Steampunk Adventure (2013–14) are only three steampunk comic book titles while video games, notably The Chaos Engine (Amiga
1993), which was inspired by The Difference Engine, also trade heavily in
steampunk motifs. As a result, steampunk has increasingly gained steam
and “has gone far beyond [such] markers [as] gaslit alleys, intrepid urchins,
steam-powered machines, and technologies that never were” to also include
such locales as “Canada, New Zealand, Wales, ancient Rome, Australia,
alternate California, and even the postapocalypse.”23 In fact, steampunk has
arguably achieved the pinnacle of cultural endurance and saturation thanks
to fashion and cosplay: clothing styles include “retro elements, most commonly from the Victorian era with such retro-tech accessories as motorists’
or pilots’ goggles (preferably brass-framed) and clockwork components. This
design aesthetic fed back into art objects, paintings, and more books – often
young-adult – which attracted more young writers. Steampunk in this
expanded sense became a widespread phenomenon that is still current.”24
While steampunk may have a stronger claim to the do-it-yourself punk
aesthetic that had initially deﬁned cyberpunk, cinematic cyberpunk recovered

The Thirteenth Floor (dir. Josef Rusnak, 1999), and The Matrix (dir. Wachowski

Device). The ﬁlm follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) and Lornette “Mace”
Mason (Angela Bassett) who get caught up in the murders of Jeriko One (Glenn
Plummer) and Iris (Brigitte Bako) when they come into possession of a SQUID
that unravels a wider conspiracy. The Thirteenth Floor, loosely based on Daniel

accused of murdering multibillionaire Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl),
whose company has created a virtual reality simulation of Los Angeles, c. 1937.
The avatars within this simulated 1930s-era Los Angeles are unaware they are
computer programs, but Hall eventually learns he too is living in a vast
simulation, c. 1999. Hall eventually ventures ofﬂine to the real world of 2024
and discovers he was a puppet in a much larger and more complicated drama.
Cronenberg’s eXistenZ fuses cyberpunk motifs with the body horror and bodily
transgressions typically associated with Cronenberg’s oeuvre, much like his
earlier Videodrome. In eXistenZ, futuristic video gamers are biotechnologically
linked to their games via game pods that attach to ports surgically implanted
into players’ spines. The ﬁlm follows Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the
creator of the eXistenZ organic reality system, as she goes on the run with Ted
Pikul (Jude Law) following an assassination attempt. As Geller tries to save
eXistenZ, reality slowly begins to dissolve into surrealism in typical
Cronenbergian fashion. Although these movies were box-ofﬁce failures and
garnered disparate reviews25 – eXistenZ earned respectable reviews; Strange
Days was divisive for critics; The Thirteenth Floor was largely trashed – they
remain important contributions to cinematic cyberpunk, particularly in their
use of visual iconography that dissolves the boundaries between “real” and
“virtual” domains, a thematic motif that achieved box-ofﬁce success with
The Matrix.
Keanu Reeves regained a wealth of cyberpunk credibility26 with his turn as
Neo in the Wachowskis’ The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded (2003), and

As the star of the titular Johnny Mnemonic, Reeves is partly to blame for his wooden
performance in an otherwise atrocious ﬁlm (visuals notwithstanding).

Cyberpunk and Post-Cyberpunk

The Matrix Revolutions (2003). The Matrix follows hacker Neo who is recruited
by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) into
a larger conﬂict with Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the Artiﬁcial
Intelligences controlling the world. Neo learns he is living in a simulation
and that he is nothing more than a battery servicing the needs of sentient
machines that are waging an ongoing war with the remnants of humanity in
the underground city of Zion. Morpheus follows the prophecy of the Oracle
(Gloria Foster) and believes he has found ‘the One’ who will bring an end to
the war. Neo doubts himself until he eventually embraces the prophecy and
learns to manipulate the digital code of the matrix, temporarily besting Agent
Smith and ﬂying off like Superman to the refrain of Rage Against the
Machine’s “Wake Up.” The sequels continue Neo’s development as he settles
into his role as the One, wages his ongoing battles against Agent Smith, and
helps to broker a truce. The Matrix Revolutions ends with a beautiful sunrise
beaming over the city and the Oracle (Mary Alice, replacing the nowdeceased Foster) professing her belief that Neo now heralds a bright future.
The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded received generally positive reviews –
The Matrix Revolutions was savaged by critics – and the series was a ﬁnancial
boon for Warner Bros. In addition, the trilogy’s success resides “not only
through its wealth of references for the scholar and the ﬁlm fan, but also
through the complexity of the narrative, which is contained within the
Hollywood ﬁlm structure. The potency of the ﬁlms thus lies in their ability
to appeal to both the popular audience and the cultural theorists.”27
The Matrix franchise,28 coupled with scores of book-length critical studies
and academic articles, ensured cyberpunk remained “fresh” heading into the
new millennium.
Part of cyberpunk’s endurance in the 1990s and into the ﬁrst decade of the
twenty-ﬁrst century was also a result of its (albeit mixed) adaptation into
television. Originally broadcast as Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future on
British Channel 4 (1985) followed by a video, music, and talk show (1985–7), the
Americanized Max Headroom debuted on ABC and ran for two seasons from
1987 to 1988. It sparked a cultural phenomenon: Max Headroom appeared in the
Art of Noise’s Paranoimia music video (1986), as the spokesperson for New

The trilogy is supplemented by other materials that comprise the franchise, such as
animated short ﬁlms bundled as The Animatrix (2003), a series of video games that started
with Enter the Matrix (Shiny Entertainment 2003), and The Matrix Comics web-based
comic series.

Coke, and on countless merchandise items. Although Scott Bukatman considers
this Max Headroom a diluted version of its British counterpart, it did address
cyberpunk “aspects of spectacular culture (including violent spectator sports . . .
information control and the invasion of privacy, television evangelism, and
terrorism and the media).”29 VR.5 ran on the Fox network in 1995 and featured
Sydney Bloom (Lori Singer), a young woman who, upon learning she can enter
virtual reality, agrees to run missions for the secretive Committee. Chris
Carter’s The X-Files made two explicitly cyberpunk-ish episodes – “Kill Switch”
(1998) and “First Person Shooter” (2000) – written by William Gibson and Tom
Maddox. In roughly the same period, Carter also launched Harsh Realm
(1999–2000) on Fox which follows Lt. Thomas Hobbes (Scott Bairstow), who
ﬁnds himself ﬁghting for his life when he is trapped inside a military simulation,
although the ﬁght didn’t last long: it was cancelled shortly after it premiered.
Dark Angel survived longer on Fox, completing two seasons from 2000 to 2002,
and it followed Max Guevara (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced runaway
from the Manticore project who is hiding from secret government agents all the
while searching for other Manticore escapees. She is assisted chieﬂy by Logan
Cale (Michael Weatherly), an underground, paraplegic cyber-journalist, and
a group of friends she maintains in her public life as a bicycle courier. Joss
Whedon returned to television after Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003), Angel
(1999–2004), and Fireﬂy (2002) with Dollhouse (2009–10) starring Buffy and Angel
alumnus Eliza Dushku as Echo, an Active or Doll, who has her entire personality wiped and alternate personalities uploaded before she is pimped out by
a clandestine organization to wealthy clients for any number of so-called
missions. Finally, Mr. Robot (2015–) follows cybersecurity engineer and hacker
Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek), who joins the hacktivist team fsociety, headed by
Mr. Robot (Christian Slater).
Cyberpunk has also a notable history in comic books; in fact, one of
cyberpunk’s chief precursors was the visual narratives collected in French
magazine Métal Hurlant, particularly Jean “Moebius” Giraud’s illustrations of
Dan O’Bannon’s “The Long Tomorrow” (1975–6). Bukatman addresses how
“Moebius’s compacted urbanism, Phillip Druillet’s saturated darkness and
Angus McKie’s scalar exaggerations” visually inﬂuenced Blade Runner; similarly, Gibson has acknowledged Neuromancer’s indebtedness to Moebius
and Métal Hurlant.30 The visual aesthetics in cyberpunk comic books are

also evident in Frank Miller and Geof Darrow’s Hard Boiled (1990–2), Paul
Pope’s Heavy Liquid (1999–2000), Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele’s
The Surrogates (2005–6), Warren Ellis and Steve Pugh’s Hotwire: Requiem for
the Dead (2009) and Hotwire: Deep Cut (2010), Philip K. Dick and Tony Parker’s
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (2009–11), and Rick Remender, Sean
Murphy, and Matt Hollingsworth’s Tokyo Ghost (2015–16), a series that also
features steampunk-ish visual aesthetics. The standout English-language
series, however, is undoubtedly Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson’s
Transmetropolitan (1997–2002). The story features the trials and tribulations
of gonzo-journalist Spider Jerusalem, who seeks the truth in a world awash
with corruption and saturated with media and technological wonders.
Jerusalem routinely ﬁnds himself at odds with the powers of authority,
including two presidents (“The Smiler” and “The Beast”), all the while
struggling against gradual urban decay, the slippery slope towards dystopia,
and the responsibilities of his own fame. Spider even breaks the fourth wall
on occasion and speaks directly to the reader, imploring them to learn the
lessons of his own cyberpunk exploits.
The notion of “post-cyberpunk” gained some early traction in the new
millennium, assisted in no small part by James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel’s
Rewired: The Post-Cyberpunk Anthology (2007), a collection of short stories that
includes more-recent offerings by Mirrorshades alumni Sterling,
Gibson, Cadigan, and Di Filippo coupled with Greg Egan’s “Yeyuka”
(1997), Gwyneth Jones’s “Red Sonja and Lessingham in Dreamland” (1996),
Charles Stross’s “Lobsters” (2001), Paolo Bacigalupi’s “The Calorie Man”
(2005), Mary Rosenblum’s “Search Engine” (2005), and Cory Doctorow’s
“When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth” (2006), to name a few titles. In their
introduction, Kelly and Kessel explain post-cyberpunk in this fashion:
The punk in post-cyberpunk [PCP] continues to make sense if it is pointing
toward an attitude: an adversarial relationship to consensus reality. This
attitude is just south of cynicism but well north of mere skepticism. It has to
do with a reaction to a world in which humanity must constantly be
renegotiated . . . The characters in a PCP story need this healthy dose of
attitude because their relationship to reality is different from ours . . . reality
itself is everywhere mediated, and what comes between the characters and
reality must constantly be interrogated.31

Nevertheless, differentiating between “cyberpunk” and “post-cyberpunk”
seems akin to splitting hairs, especially considering the cyberpunk label is
unwilling to give up the ghost, as shown by Pat Cadigan’s The Ultimate
Cyberpunk (2002) or Cyberpunk: Stories of Hardware, Software, Wetware,
Evolution, and Revolution (2013), edited by Victoria Blake and featuring the
usual suspects – Gibson, Sterling, Cadigan, Shiner, Rucker, Di Filippo, and
Shirley – and such unlikely entrants as Kim Stanley Robinson (“Down and
Out in the Year 2000” [1986]), David Marusek (“Getting to Know You”
[1998]), or Daniel H. Wilson (“The Nostalgist” [2009]). At the same time,
cyberpunk, post-cyberpunk, or cyberpunk-ish novels of the new millennium include Justina Robson’s Silver Screen (1999) and Mappa Mundi (2001),
Richard K. Morgan’s Takeshi Kovacs series (Altered Carbon [2002], Broken
Angels [2003], and Woken Furies [2005]) and Market Forces (2004), Marianne de
Pierres’s Parrish Plessis series (Nylon Angel [2004], Code Noir [2004], and
Crash Deluxe [2005]), Daniel Suarez’s Daemon (2006) and Freedom (2010),
Adam Sternbergh’s Near Enemy (2015), K. C. Alexander’s Necrotech (2016),
Matthew de Abaitua’s The Destructives (2016), or Annalee Newitz’s
Autonomous (2017). Cyberpunk aesthetics have even ﬁltered into such
young adult titles as M. T. Anderson’s Feed (2002), Cory Doctorow’s Little
Brother (2008) and Homeland (2013), James Dashner’s The Morality Doctrine
series (The Eye of Minds [2013], The Rule of Thoughts [2014], The Game of Lives
[2015]), Patrick Ness’s More Than This (2013), and Ernest Cline’s Ready Player
One (2011), to again name a few titles. At the same time, Lars Schmeink,
channeling Brian McHale, points to the phenomenon of biopunk as
a cyberpunk sub-variety “which has since grown into a larger and more
varied cultural formation” and, by the end of the twentieth century, “the
genetically engineered posthuman has brought forth a cultural formation of
biopunk that spans many different forms of culture.”32 Biopunk examples in
Schmeink’s study include Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy (Oryx and
Crake [2003], The Year of the Flood [2009], and MaddAddam [2013]),
Bacigalupi’s award-winning The Windup Girl (2009), the ﬁlm Splice (dir.
Vincenzo Natali, 2009), or the video game BioShock (Irrational Games and
Looking Glass Studios [2007]). Nevertheless, the ongoing work from yesterday’s cyberpunks, including such forefathers as William Gibson
(The Peripheral [2014]) and Bruce Sterling (Pirate Utopia [2016]), coupled

with an endurance despite competition from steampunk and biopunk,
show a thriving market for cyberpunk in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
It bears noting that cyberpunk is not a strictly North American phenomenon. For example, Japanese cyberpunk was a popular cinematic subgenre
in Japan, organized chieﬂy around such directors as Shigeru Izumiya (Death
Powder [1986]), Shin’ya Tsukamoto (Tetsuo: The Iron Man [1989]), and Shozin
Fukui (√964 Pinocchio [1991], Rubber’s Lover [1996]). Although largely
unknown outside Japan, Death Powder is “arguably the ﬁrst ﬁlm of Japan’s
extreme cyberpunk movement, exemplifying the invasive, corporeal surrealism that would follow over the next ten years.”33 Japanese cyberpunk
rejected much of what had been popularized in North American cyberpunk
to instead focus on visions of “industrial scrap – Tetsuo – and makeshift
laboratories built from crude and dated equipment – Rubber’s Lover – lending a DIY aesthetic to their overall ethos.”34 Finally, Japanese cyberpunk
was often set in “the present-day, real-life cyberpunk city of Tokyo, suggesting that anxieties over rapid modernity are not some far-off venture but
something that should be worried about now,”35 anxieties that also formed
the core of much Japanese anime and manga, particularly Katsuhiro
Ôtomo’s Akira (1982–90 [manga]; 1988 [anime]) and Masmune Shirow’s
Ghost in the Shell franchise.
Ôtomo’s voluminous Akira is set in post-World War III Neo-Tokyo and
follows the adventures of Tetsuo Shima and Shōtarō Kaneda as they navigate
a complex and bloody world featuring post-apocalyptic biker gangs, biological mutations, and secret military agencies. It is on this sprawling canvas of
“nuclear blasts, high-speed bike chases, and profuse gunplay [that] Ôtomo
used the protagonists’ predicament to explore the value of friendship, the
isolation and disillusionment of youth subcultures, and the state of the
subject faced with corrupt, irresponsible authorities.”36 Akira achieved
remarkable success, in part a result of Ôtomo’s anime adaptation as well as
its import by Marvel Comics’ Epic Comics imprint that translated and
digitally colorized Akira for a North American audience. Masmune
Shirow’s Ghost in the Shell franchise has also proved immensely popular in
domestic and international markets with its ongoing tales of Major Motoko

Kusanagi, a cyborg ofﬁcer and squad leader of Public Security Section 9, who
struggles with her identity as a “‘ghost’ of human essence [that] inhabits
a state-of-the-art ‘machine,’ at times rendering the soul, as well as the ﬂesh
and blood understanding of human life, as mere data – a freely transferable
artiﬁcial intelligence desperately seeking to maintain its own singularity and
identity.”37 Ghost in the Shell has therefore proved to be both successful and
immensely important as a transmedia product, including Ghost in the Shell
(1989–1990 [manga]; 1995 [anime]); Ghost in the Shell 2: Man–Machine Interface
(1991–7 [manga]); Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004 [anime]); Ghost in the
Shell: Stand Alone Complex (2002 [TV animation]); Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd
GIG (2004 [TV animation]); Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
The Laughing Man (2005 [original video animation]); Ghost in the Shell: Stand
Alone Complex Individual Eleven (2006 [original video animation]; Ghost in the
Shell: Stand Alone Complex – Solid State Society (2006 [anime]); Ghost in the Shell:
The New Movie (2015 [anime]), and Hollywood’s Ghost in the Shell (dir. Rupert
Sanders, 2017), although this Hollywood version was a critical and ﬁnancial
failure, in part because of the whitewashing controversy surrounding casting
Scarlett Johansson in the lead role.
Cyberpunk has also gone increasingly global. For example, Sleep Dealer
(dir. Alex Rivera, 2008) is set largely in Mexico and focuses on three intersecting characters: Memo Cruz, a young hacker who is forced to leave his
home and ﬁnd work in Tijuana as a node worker (“sleep dealer”); Luz
Martínez, an idealistic journalist who uploads her daily memories and experiences to an online vlog on a pay-per-play basis; and, Rudy Ramirez, a drone
pilot whose missions to secure corporate water rights are the subject of
a Cops-style television show called Drones. As Sherryl Vint writes regarding
Memo’s experiences, “in contrast to what we expect of heroes in cyberpunk
ﬁction, whose mastery within cyberspace transforms their marginal position
in the material world into one of mastery within cyberspace, Memo remains
marginalized in both material and virtual realms,”38 although both Luz and
Rudy undergo their own marginalization in this digital global economy.
Of course, marginalization and global economics are familiar for residents
of Cuba, and in his study of the relationship between SF and Cuba’s social
reality, Juan C. Toledano Redondo notes that “despite the late publication

and limited publication of cyberpunk texts, they were absorbed quickly in
Cuba during the late 1990s, condensing the evolution of the subgenre into
just a few years.”39 Toledano Redondo points to such Cuban authors as Yoss
(José Miguel Sánchez), Vladimir Hernández Pacín, and Michel Encinosa Fú
in such collections as Timshel and Reino eterno: Cuentos de fantasía y ciencia
ﬁcción (Eternal Kingdom: Stories of fantasy and science ﬁction, Yoss, 1989;
1999), Interfase: Selección de cuentos cyberpunk and Nova de cuarzo (Hernández
Paćin, 1997; 1999), and Niños de neón (Fu, 2001) to show how “Cuban
cyberpunk style rebels against both socialist realism and imperialistic latecapitalism.”40
Perhaps cyberpunk’s most widespread inﬂuence resides with the multibillion dollar gaming industry. Scholars have pointed out the pervasive
“cyberpunk-ness” of role-playing games (e.g., Cyberpunk 2020, R. Talsorian
Games, 2010) and video games that maintain the visual aesthetic established
by even the earliest cyberpunk, including Final Fantasy (Square Enix,
1987–present), Neuromancer (Interplay, 1988), System Shock (Looking
Glass, 1994) and System Shock 2 (Irrational Games, 1999), Shadowrun
(BlueSky, 1994), Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri (Firaxis, 1999), Rez (Sega, 2001),
Darwinia (Introversion, 2005), Dystopia (Puny Human Games, 2007), the Mass
Effect franchise (Bioware, 2007–present), Deus Ex: Human Revolution (Square
Enix, 2011), Remember Me (Dontnod Entertainment, 2013), and Watch Dogs
(Ubisoft, 2014).41 Since the gaming industry remains healthy, there is every
reason to believe cyberpunk will continue to inﬂuence it.
In the end, cyberpunk has diversiﬁed and inﬁltrated popular culture to
such an extent that it is difﬁcult to think of it as a deﬁnable genre or subgenre;
instead, Thomas Foster, drawing upon the work of Lawrence Grossberg,
explains it isn’t so much a “genre, which is organized around ‘the existence of
necessary formal elements,’ [as] a cultural formation [which is] a historical
articulation of textual practices with ‘a variety of other cultural, social,

economic, historical and political practices.’”42 As a cultural formation,
cyberpunk has always already been extrapolating upon techno-mediated
realities while it continues to integrate “worlds that were formerly separate:
the realm of high tech, and the modern pop underground.”43 Cyberpunk has
experienced “a sea change into a more generalized cultural formation”44
since it ﬁrst burst forth in the 1980s and it continues to evolve and expand
in response to changing global conditions. We are arguably living in cyberpunk’s futures, so our cyberpunk ﬁctions – past, present, and future – are
more important today than they have ever been.
